# hybrid-ddc_seal_mashups
Rough drafts of mashups of the hybrid ddc examples and the seal example.

The originals are here: https://github.com/capablevms/cheri-examples/tree/master/hybrid check them out and drop these files into the directory structure. 

Then build them ./cheribuild.py -d -f run-morello-hybrid â€”enable-hybrid-targets 
and you can run them as root on QEMU.
